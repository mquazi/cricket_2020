You need to edit auto.R for the eight teams, they are all structured the same way as those earlier 12 nation files... 

Eight teams are Royal Challengers Bangalore, Chennai Super Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals, King's IX Punjab. 
For example, Royal Challengers Bangalore's auto file is 'rcbauto.R', it inputs 'rcb.csv', and outputs 're.csv' (first letter and last letter) for that team...  
So we need re.csv, cs.csv, ks.csv and so on...
